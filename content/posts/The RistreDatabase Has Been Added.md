Today after a few months of test-logging and getting things working properly I added my database of Monster Hunter footage - the "RistreDatabase" - to the site. 

I'm hosting the project here because I want it to have a 'landing page' that isn't just a textbox inside of Google Docs. A page folks can be linked to with an easy description of how to use the spreadsheet and my justification for making a small project like this public.

Here's an excerpt from the project page's "Why make this:" section.

>The RistreDatabase came about when I wanted to start logging all of my stream footage from Twitch. I use [the InfoWriter OBS plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/infowriter.345/) to log timestamps live while broadcasting, then use that to mark and label each hunt appropriately in Davinci Resolve while editing the footage for YouTube.
>
>Doing this is useful for me to be able to track down specific footage or find precise moments in our Monster Hunter playthroughs, and also enables me to add timestamps to each of the archived VODs on YouTube. This makes it easier for viewers to triage the videos on YouTube, and by surfacing this data online in the ristreDatabase it allows me and anyone else interested to filter down large amounts of footage by monster, hunt rank, weapon, game, date, or any combination inbetween.
>
>I began logging footage like this in November of 2021 after upgrading my streaming computer, so older VODs on YouTube aren't currently included in the database. I may begin adding those to the database manually for the sake of completion, but haven't begun doing so at this time. If you're planning to watch through older VODs and are interested in contributing timestamps to the database please [reach out and contact me](https://ristrettorambles.com/about/#me-elsewhere) so I can give you editing access to the database.

>Cheers & happy browsing, ~M

Today felt like a pretty big day in tech news. I won’t actually go into any detail here, for I feel ill-equipped and under-read to provide meaningful commentary. Only time will tell how influential the day’s headlines actually shape up to be, but today *felt* like a big one. 

I spent more time scrolling through the flotsam of the news than I normally would (scrolling that could surely be more trouble than it’s worth), and despite the mess, I was left feeling like I wanted to contribute more to the area of online-tech again. A “long time ago” in high school there were a few years where I dutifully made many, many shoddily-written blog posts, and I remember how incredibly energized that made me feel at the time. 

In the intermediary years I’ve still been insisting to myself that I want to pick that up again (hopefully sans the shoddily-written part), to the point that there are a baker’s dozen of partially-written pieces sitting in my computer’s text files. Pieces that I’d have been proud to see through to completion… but haven’t. 

Something about today’s tech shifts and the accompanying discourse  caused a stir in me about that. So I’m sitting down and writing a tiny blurb of that feeling so that it’s here, and so that I wrote about it, and so I published it. 

Like today’s news, we’ll see if having done so shapes up to be anything of consequence. Cheers!

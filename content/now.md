# What I'm Doing Now:
*As updated on November 5th, 2022.*

### Practicing photography:

This summer I purchased my first new-to-me camera in a decade, which quickly snowballed into researching, learning, and practicing a whole lot about photography these last few months. Since then I've shot my way through several late-summer trips, traipsed all around our small town looking for views and moments worth capturing, and *yes* bought probably a bit too much in the way of photo gear. I'm still very much getting my bearings when it comes to subject matter, preferred focal lengths, and the actual *purpose* with which I'm shooting photos, but I'm betting that through continuing to shoot these aspects will continue to become clearer to me.

### Cutting back on internet-distractions again:

Partially thanks to all my photography (cough-*gear*-cough) research,  I've been watching more videos, shopping more sites, and just spending more time *consuming* things online than I'm really comfortable with. It's been about a year now since I first started more seriously [assessing my attention](https://ristrettorambles.com/posts/assessing-my-attention/) and how it relates to my computer usage, and I think it's about time I stepped back and took another big "cleanse".

### Struggling with sleep and routine: 

Maybe in part due to the changing seasons, but I've had a lot of trouble recenty with my sleep schedule and following any sort of consistent routine for my day. Some nights I'll stay up till 5am, while others I'm too tired out to start a 10pm broadcast to Twitch. Other days I'm awake by 8am and finish the day's work by 3 or 4pm, while on other days both those start and end times are well after noon. Another part of this is definitely owed to my entirely remote job not requiring a strict set of "active hours" from me. When the hours themselves don't matter as much, it's entirely up to me how I structure and prioritize my day. I'll be focusing on building up that personal accountability as I continue to settle into my role at ZSA and as the dim winter months roll through.

### Enjoying Sunbreak to the end:

Earlier this year I was worried about if I'd be able to focus on "doing my own thing" and enjoying Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak my way regardless of others complaints with the game, and I feel like that's been a resounding success. I'm several hundred hours into the expansion and still only have a fuzzy idea of what the end is fully like, or what setups most players have decided on being the "most effective" way to play. It reminds me of some of my other favorite "first time" experiences in the MH-series; with my understanding and experience slowly growing as I go, rather than rushing or tapping into the whole of the internet for other player's "solved" impressions and tactics for the game. I've definitely been reaching some of the tougher stuff in the game onstream lately, which feels good to rally against some nights and a little too intense on others. I do think I'll be ready to send off the game sometime in the next few months, but until then I'm determined to see it through and finish off with some wickedly fun challenges. :)

### Readying for another northern winter:

Lastly, I'm gradually coming to look forward to another winter up here in Michigans' upper peninsula. I really enjoyed shooting photos during the warmer months, so I'm sad to see the "nicer" weather leave. I did  come to enjoy the several deep winter months last year where the snowfall was omnipresent -- daily blanketing every lawn and street corner with a fresh dusting of white. Let's just say that for now I'm very thankful my daily commute has shifted to one that spans the length of our apartment, but I'm excited to get out in the cold and photograph what might be Ann√© and my last winter here as well.

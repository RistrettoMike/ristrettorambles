# What I'm Doing Now:
*As updated on June 4th, 2022.*

### Training At My New Job:

I'm a little over halfway through the hands-on training for my new job at an as-of-yet-unnamed small business & mechanical keyboard company. Working remotely for the first time has been an interesting change to get used to, and I'm still acclimating to the workload, my routine, and how to fit in time with my hobbies and loved ones around the work that needs doing. Oh, and I'll get my own keyboard from them soon -- very exciting!

### Ramping Up For Sunbreak:

After a few months of deliberation where I thought I might not stream the latest entry in my favorite game series (the upcoming large expansion [Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak](https://www.monsterhunter.com/rise-sunbreak/)), I've decided to both play it at launch *and* focus on enjoying myself and staying positive. That can be tough in the midst of a very "online" community that tends to jump to conclusions and work themselves up in ways that can be draining if paid too much mind -- so I'll be working at... not paying too much mind and having fun instead!

### Enjoying The Warmer Weather:

Sometime in the last month or so it finally got to be warm here in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, so Anné and I have been taking advantage of that with some nice evening walks and meals outside. I've also been trying my best to get slightly more active by dragging us to Anné's university athletics center for excercise, but that's still in the "getting off the ground" phase of routine.

### Reading More and Watching Less:

This month is the first time I can actually feel my addiction to YouTube finally abating. I've been reading more of [Dan Simmon's Hyperion Cantos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos), sleeping slighty better, and watching a little less from channels/creators I wouldn't have missed an upload from in the past. This year has been such a rude awakening to how addicted my brain was to various digital "pacifiers", so I hope I can continue to steer myself in a better direction.

### Thinking About Writing More:
But struggling to commit. 

Between work, streaming to Twitch, attempting to keep our apartment clean/stocked, spending time with Anné, and a bit of rest when necessary -- I have a hard time dedicating myself to writing much. I really want to change that, though.
